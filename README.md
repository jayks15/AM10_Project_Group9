# UFO Sightings Analysis - Data Visualisation Course Group Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing patterns in UFO sightings, using various data visualization and statistical techniques. The goal is to explore geographical, temporal, and socio-environmental trends in UFO sightings, understand public interest and reporting biases, and identify unique clusters and anomalies in the data.

## Research Questions

Our aim for this research program is to explore global and time-dimension trends in UFO sightings, analyzing their geographic distribution and potential associations with nearby points of interest such as military bases, cities, and natural landmarks. We will examine temporal variations in sighting rates, focusing on identifying any seasonal, monthly, or daily patterns to reveal temporally specific patterns. In addition, we hope to uncover differences across locations by characterizing the shape, description, and duration of common sightings. Through cluster analysis, we will identify unique event patterns and apparently anomalous sightings to locate those locations or time periods with unusual concentrations of sightings for further study.

## Data Resources and Description

The UFO sightings dataset, titled "UFO Datasets - The Truth is Out There" and hosted on Kaggle, provides a comprehensive collection of global UFO sightings, including key details such as the date, time, location, and descriptions of each sighting. This dataset aggregates historical records of UFO sightings, capturing temporal, geographic, and descriptive information that enables detailed analysis.

## Methodology

### Descriptive Statistics

-   **Measures:** Mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to summarize key features (e.g., average duration of sightings, frequency of sightings per region).
-   **Frequency Tables:** Identify the most common types of sightings or most frequently observed locations.

### Time Series Analysis

-   **Trend Analysis:** Observe changes in UFO sightings over time, potentially by month, season, or year.
-   **Seasonal Decomposition:** Identify recurring seasonal patterns or periodic trends in sightings.

### Correlation Analysis

-   **Correlation/Regression:** Explore relationships between variables, such as population density and sighting frequency or weather conditions and sighting frequency.

### Geospatial Analysis

-   **Heat Maps:** Visualize sighting counts by geographic region and identify areas with unusually high sighting densities.

### Regression Analysis

-   **Linear Regression:** Explore factors that might predict sighting frequency (e.g., population density, proximity to certain landmarks).
-   **Logistic Regression:** Predict whether or not a sighting will occur based on certain conditions.

### Clustering Techniques

-   **K-means or Hierarchical Clustering:** Group sightings by characteristics such as location, time, and description to reveal common patterns or distinct clusters.
